# Pycsou Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to your shiny new codespace! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Pycsou from the conveniency of Jupyter notebooks.

Everything you do here is contained within this one codespace. There is no repository on GitHub. When you are done exploring and have no further need for the exploration code then you can simply delete your codespace and it's gone forever.
